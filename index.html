  <h2>1. Video Presentation</h2>

  <h2>2. Project Summary</h2>

  <h3>Device Description</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Our device “AirLight” is an IoT (Internet of Things) based Air Quality Monitoring, Alerting and Actuating system
      incorporated with an Ambient light measurement and modulating system which could be utilized for continuous
      checking of the Air Quality (ppm/ppb) and Light Intensity(lux) levels at home.</li>
    <li>The IoT enabled device is coupled with sensors such as CCS811 (Air Quality IC)(offboard), VEML6030 (Ambient
      Light Sensor)(onboard) to detect; and actuators such as SG92R SERVO motor, Lilypad RGB LED to take necessary
      action based on the obtained data evaluated against set thresholds and standards.</li>
    <li>A Node Red dashboard has been implemented to display the monitored data and to communicate bi-directionally
      delivering Over-the-Air-Firmware-Updates(OTAFU) to the users.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Inspiration</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Recent incident of two master’s students in the US - passed away due to Carbon Monoxide (CO) poisoning from air
      heater. A serious gas leak happens every 40 hours in the USA, claims more than 120 per year.</li>
    <li>The smoke detectors that are generally installed in our houses do not detect the presence of any specific gas
      except for smoke and heat presence. This leads to false triggering or no alert at all in the case of invisible and
      non heat generating gas emissions which might be fatal. Very few people understand this and install gas alarms and
      gas detectors in their houses but that doesn't completely do the trick as well because it just alerts the user
      through the alarm being raised but no action is immediately taken to save the user. Many a times the user is not
      completely conscious during sleep even when the loud alarm is raised. So any delay in reacting to the gas presence
      by taking an evasive action could be critical and lead to death.</li>
    <li>So our IoT based smart solution tackles this problem by actuating a sliding door which improves the ventilation
      of the room and also turns on the fan acting like an exhaust. This mechanism gives the user a bit of leeway to
      escape or assess the situation and take corrective measures while the Air Quality Index of the room is being
      restored back to normal.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Device Functionality</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>AirLight has an Air Quality Index(AQI) Sensor mounted on one of the walls of the house and an onboard Ambient
      Light Sensor(ALS) on the PCBA. AQI sensor looks for the presence of Carbon Dioxide(CO2) and Total Volatile Organic
      Compounds(TVOC) in its vicinity and reports the values in parts per million (ppm) and parts per billion (ppb)
      respectively every 4.5 seconds to the SAMD21 microcontroller that is mounted and programmed on the PCBA. The ALS
      sensor gives the lux value every 5 seconds to the SAMD21.</li>
    <li>These readings are processed by the microcontroller in separate tasks out of which the AQI sensor readings have
      higher priority than the ALS sensor readings as the air quality index of the room is much more critical than the
      ambient light. When the CO2 level of the room goes above 3000 ppm or the TVOC level goes above 300 ppb (as per
      World Health Organization (WHO) recommended levels and permissible exposure limits (PEL)), the SERVO motor is
      actuated which is connected via a Rack & Pinion gear system to the sliding window/door of the room. The door is
      opened and the fan is turned on allowing for air flow to improve the air quality. In a case when the AQI readings
      are nominal and the ambient light levels are too low - <100 lux - the RGB LED is turned on facilitating higher
        illuminance levels in the room which is recommended as per international standards for living and bed
        rooms(100-200lux).</li>
    <li>The entire systems powered by a Li-Ion Battery that lasts for a continuous 5 hours since the nominal current
      consumption of the device is 300mA and the peak current consumption is 1.1A when the SERVO is actuated. This means
      that the battery rated to 3.7V with a full charged capacity of 2200mAh can power the device for around 7hrs, but
      considering the discharge characteristics of the Li-Ion battery, 5hrs of safe operation could be achieved. The IoT
      device has been tested for 3hrs of continuous operation without any issue.</li>
    <li>The obtained data of CO2 and TVOC values along with the lux levels in the room are continuously relayed to the
      MQTT based Node-Red Dashboard which displays the information to the user in real-time. History of the levels is
      stored on the Azure server and is timestamped and represented through the use of graphs. The user has an option of
      remotely opening the door of the house through the click of a button on the dashboard or could even turn on the
      RGB LED through an interactive button. The Node-Red Dashboard also features a functionality to push an
      over-the-air-firmware-upadte to the IoT Device with latest updates and features if any.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Challenges</h3>
  <p>Most of our challenges were firmware and integration related:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> CCS811 Air Quality Sensor Programming
      <ul>
        <li>The CCS811 Air Quality Sensor programming wasn't very straightforward and required a lot of registers on the
          module to be sensitively handled by writing correct sequences at the right instances to enable the sensing.
        </li>
        <li>We had to go through a lot of datasheets and programming guides to get this to working. There was one guide
          that we found which was really helpful in understanding the flow of the sensor. But somehow the application
          binary that was present on the sensor was erased or was not responding to the register acceses.</li>
        <li>We solved this through flashing the application binary onto the sensor using an Arduino ATMEGA board for
          which the code was available open-source on github. The flashed sensor started accessing the registers
          correctly and we were able to summon measurements from the sensor at specific time intervals.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> VEML6030 Ambient Light Sensor Programming
      <ul>
        <li>The ambient light sensor requires repeated starts of I2C reads and writes which we didn't know as nothing of
          that sort was mentioned on the datasheet of this sensor.
        </li>
        <li>Upon discussions with Detkin staff and TAs we came to know that a new block of code with repeated starts of
          I2CRead and I2CWrite was to be written for this purpose. Doing this solved the issue and we were able to take
          the sensor readings immmediately on the register specified.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Task Handling and Overflow
      <ul>
        <li>We were seeing a lot of stack overflows and program getting stuck after a actuating function was being
          called inside a sensor task.</li>
        <li>We were able to solve this by playing with the stack sizes of different tasks and also by making sure that
          the tasks are not blocking each other. Sufficient delay between the tasks was essential in the smooth
          functionality which was achieved through vTaskDelay feature in FreeRTOS.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> SERVO Motor Jitter and Functionality Errors
      <ul>
        <li>The SERVO we chose for opening and closing the window was not functioning properly as desired with complete
          rotation (in its possible range).</li>
        <li>The reason was because the pulse widths modulation being passed on to it were not perfect and hence its
          behaviour was erratic. We fixed the issue with a very minute jitter still seen through incorporating for loops
          to repeatedly passing the PWM signal to the motor when required.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Laser Cutting / 3D Printing of the House Model
      <ul>
        <li>Initially we submitted 3D printing request for the House Model. Even though the model fit the size
          requirements of all the printers in Tangen Hall, Detkin Makerspace, Biotech Commons and Education Commons, the
          job time was exceeding 24 hours and hence our 3D printing request was getting denied.</li>
        <li>A workaround we were able to figure out for this was laser cutting the walls, roof and the base of the house
          and joining them together using acrylic solvent. Another issue faced during this shift from 3D printing to
          Laser Cutting was that the dimensions created in the 3D CAD model differed from the acrylic sheets available
          for laser cutting. So a re-work on the CAD design was necessary. We were able to get the model together with
          all parts glued nicely together as desired.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Next Steps for Improvement</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Inclusion of an SMS delivery mechanism would complete the loop in terms of alerting not just the user but their
      emergency contacts as well.</li>
    <li>Turning off the Air heating system which is causing the gas leak and integrating the control of the heating
      system with the IoT device.</li>
    <li>The data obtained from sensing the air quality and ambient light could be analyzed in terms of weather,
      environment and power consumption standards and used for improving device performance. Illuminance in the room
      could be improved and automated based on time-of-day along with the sensor measurements </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Takeaways from ESE5160</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We learnt how a complete IoT solution could be designed and delivered in a short span of 3 months even with very
      less experience in PCB design and firmware programming.</li>
    <li>The assignments were crucial in enabling a progressive style of learning which helped us understand topics on
      the go while developing the project prototype at the same time.</li>
    <li>The lectures were important to understand the intricacies through experiences of the professor and the slides
      were very helpful to refer back to when some kind of design/debugging query arises.</li>

  <h2>3. Hardware & Software Requirements</h2>

  <h3>3.1 Hardware Requirements</h3>
  <p>The hardware requirements for the AirLight IoT-based solution product are outlined as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>HRS 01: Microcontroller Unit</strong>: The project will be powered by the SAMW25 microcontroller, which
      integrates two co-processors: SAMD21G18A for processing and ATWINC1500 for WiFi capabilities.</li>
    <li><strong>HRS 02: Power Module</strong>: The IoT device will employ the BQ24075 charging circuit, compatible with
      a 4.4V to 5.25V USB power source. This setup will be complemented by a 3.3V 2200mAh Lithium Ion battery. To ensure
      efficient operation, all components will be powered at 3.3V. A buck converter will be integrated into the system
      design to achieve stable 3.3V output.</li>
    <li><strong>HRS 03: Air Quality IC</strong>: Air quality will be monitored using the CCS811 Air Quality IC (3.3V),
      measuring levels in ppm (parts per million) or ppb (parts per billion). The microcontroller will interact with
      this sensor via the I2C protocol. The sensor has a CO2 measurement range from 400ppm to 29206ppm and TVOC
      measurement from 0ppb to 32768ppb, with an accuracy of approximately ±5%.</li>
    <li><strong>HRS 04: Ambient Light Sensor</strong>: Ambient light intensity will be monitored using the VEML6030
      sensor (3.3V), communicating with the microcontroller via I2C. This onboard sensor has a dynamic range of 0 lux to
      ~140 kilo lux, offering high resolution down to 0.0042 lx/counts.</li>
    <li><strong>HRS 05: Servo Motor</strong>: Based on readings from the CCS811 air quality sensor, a servo motor (3.3V)
      will be employed for actuation. The SAMW25 microcontroller will trigger the servo motor to open or close
      windows/doors to improve indoor air quality.</li>
    <li><strong>HRS 06: RGB LED Light</strong>: Ambient lighting will be managed using an RGB LED light bulb (3.3V),
      controlled by the SAMW25 microcontroller based on data from the VEML6030 ambient light sensor.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These hardware components and their functionalities collectively enable the AirLight IoT solution to effectively
    monitor air quality and ambient conditions, facilitating automated actions to enhance indoor air quality and
    lighting levels.</p>

  <h3>3.2 Software Requirements</h3>
  <p>Here are the software requirements for the AirLight IoT-based solution product:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>HRS 01 - SAMW25 Microcontroller</strong>: Our project is based on a self-designed PCB. The MCU of this
      PCB is the SAMW25 microcontroller, with J-link used to flash the code into the PCB.</li>
    <li><strong>HRS 02 - SHTC3-TR-10KS Sensor</strong>: In compliance with HRS 02, our system employs the SHTC3-TR-10KS
      sensor, which detects a wide range of temperature (-40 °C to 125 °C) and humidity (0 to 100 %RH). The typical
      accuracy is ±2 %RH for humidity and ±0.2°C for temperature, but our software configuration displays accuracy to
      ±1°C for temperature and ±1 %RH for humidity due to integer data type limitations.</li>
    <li><strong>HRS 03 - 1.8" Color TFT LCD with SPI Interface</strong>: The implementation of the 1.8" Color TFT LCD
      with an SPI interface in our project was crucial for displaying detailed product information. This LCD module
      communicates with the microcontroller through the SPI, ensuring swift and stable data updates.</li>
    <li><strong>HRS 04 - Tiny Code Reader from Useful Sensors</strong>: The Tiny Code Reader captures and interprets QR
      codes effectively, with an LED indicator that signals the scanning process status. It communicates with the
      microcontroller via I2C, changing from blue to green upon a successful scan.</li>
    <li><strong>HRS 05 - ADA1201 Vibrating Motor</strong>: The ADA1201 vibrating motor is integrated as a tactile
      feedback mechanism. It sends a vibration alert each time an item is scanned and when the user finishes shopping,
      enhancing the user experience with immediate physical feedback.</li>
    <li><strong>HRS 06 - System Integration and Control</strong>: Our development team has implemented a system that
      integrates multiple hardware components to ensure smooth and efficient operation. The device operates on a 3.7V
      Li-Ion battery, with a tested continuous operational capability of at least 3 hours.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All our sensors and actuators worked as per initial plan. Sensors produced results as per their respective
    datsheets and the SAM D21 was able to use the function calls of the actuators inside the sensor tasks based on the
    firmware programmed into it. The RGB LED worked perfectly as the ambient light went below 100lux and turned on. The
    SERVO motor turned on thereby opening the sliding door of the house model via a rack-pinion gear setup. The SERVO
    had a small bit of jitter though - that was due to the PWM control not being upto mark on the SERVO. </p>
